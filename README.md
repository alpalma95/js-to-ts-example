# JavaScript to TypeScript

This is the material for a professional workshop about TypeScript. For this workshop, we will be migrating a sample app from Vanilla JS to TypeScript.

## Branches
- `main`: Here you can find the initial app written in vanilla JS
- `ts-init`: In this branch, we will find the initial setup for starting to rewrite the app in TypeScript (All files with `.ts` extension and vite config ready)
- `ts-end`: Finally, we will have the final app fully rewritten in TypeScript
